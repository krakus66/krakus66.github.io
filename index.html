<h1>Welcome to NEW LIFE ASIA</h1><h2>an online ministry dedicated to preach the Gospel about Jesus Christ in Asia</h2> 

<p align=left> 

In 1990, I had my personal resurrection experience: Jesus spoke to me.<br>
It took place in a small basement appartment while reading a Christian novel. I heard Him saying, "And you pray so little!" I was shocked and exclaimed: "So You are alive, Lord!" Then, I burst into tears realizing the quality of life I was living.
But since that day, my life has belonged to Him entirely. I was changed. I offered my life to Him and He has chosen me to preach His Holy Name in different parts of Asia. <br>
Because that experience was helped by reading the Bible and Christian inspirational books,
it made me to realize the importance of praying with the Bible and reading the testimonies of other brothers and sisters in Christ.
<br>Through this website I want to share my knowledge of God's word and my experiences in faith.
May this testimony lead the reader to Jesus who is our Way, our Truth, and our Life.
